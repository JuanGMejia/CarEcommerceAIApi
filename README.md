# Car E-Commerce AI API

A modern, scalable backend API for a car e-commerce platform, built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and leveraging AI-powered chat, Azure Blob Storage, OpenAI embeddings, and Qdrant vector database for advanced search and conversational experiences.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This project follows a modular, service-oriented architecture using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) as the core framework. Key components include:

- **NestJS**: Main application framework for scalable server-side Node.js development.
- **OpenAI**: Used for generating embeddings and chat completions to power intelligent conversational features.
- **Qdrant**: Vector database for semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Stores user conversations and data files for embedding.
- **Azure AD Authentication**: Secures endpoints using JWT tokens via Azure Active Directory.
- **Application Insights**: Integrated for telemetry and logging.
- **Docker**: Containerized for easy deployment and CI/CD integration.

### High-Level Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Secured via Azure AD JWT tokens.
2. **Chat Endpoint**: Receives user messages, generates embeddings, retrieves relevant context from Qdrant, and responds using OpenAI's GPT model.
3. **Embeddings**: Text data is chunked, embedded with OpenAI, and indexed in Qdrant for fast semantic search.
4. **Conversation Storage**: User conversations are persisted in Azure Blob Storage for context and continuity.
5. **Conversation Storage**: Prompt is downloaded from blob and stored in cache to optimize the response time.
6. **Observability**: Application Insights logs events and errors for monitoring.
